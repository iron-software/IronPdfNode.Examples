### IronPDF: A Comprehensive .NET PDF Library

IronPDF is a robust library designed for developers using C# to enable rich document management functionalities within .NET applications. This includes converting HTML to PDF, generating PDFs dynamically, and modifying existing PDF files with extensive features. IronPDF simplifies complex tasks with its straightforward API, ensuring seamless integration.

#### Quick Installation

Begin by installing IronPDF through NuGet with the following package manager command:

```plaintext
PM> Install-Package IronPdf
```

#### Generating PDFs from HTML

IronPDF allows conversion of HTML pages to PDF documents seamlessly. Here's how you can convert a simple HTML string to PDF:

```csharp
// Create an instance of the Renderer
var Renderer = new IronPdf.HtmlToPdf();

// Render an HTML string as a PDF in memory
var PDF = Renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello World</h1>");

// Save the PDF to a file
PDF.SaveAs("hello-world.pdf");
```

This code snippet illustrates creating a PDF from HTML by first initiating a rendering instance and then processing an HTML string with the `RenderHtmlAsPdf` method, followed by saving the output to a specified directory.

#### Advanced Usage: Adding Assets

When your HTML content includes external resources such as CSS, images, and JavaScript, IronPDF efficiently handles these through the following approach:

```csharp
// Define the Base URL to load assets
Renderer.RenderingOptions.BaseUrl = @"C:\site\assets\";

// Convert HTML including external assets to a PDF
var PDFWithAssets = Renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<img src='icons/iron.png'>");

// Save the advanced PDF
PDFWithAssets.SaveAs("html-with-assets.pdf");
```

Here, the `BaseUrl` property of `RenderingOptions` ensures all relative paths in the HTML are resolved correctly, allowing IronPDF to render a pixel-perfect PDF document.

#### Conclusion

IronPDF offers a comprehensive set of tools for generating and manipulating PDF documents within .NET environments. It supports a broad range of .NET versions and project types, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to integrate PDF functionalities into their applications.
