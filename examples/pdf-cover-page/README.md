The initial page of a PDF, commonly known as the cover page, significantly enhances the document's overall presentation. This paramount page is typically positioned at the forefront of the document and incorporates vital elements such as the title, author information, logos, and other branding components. This cover page not only facilitates document identification but also augments visual appeal and strengthens brand recognition for various businesses and organizations.

Beyond its aesthetic contribution, the cover page also aids in the swift recognition of the documentâ€™s content and origin, simplifying document navigation for readers. Additionally, it may meet specific legal or compliance demands, particularly within formal or judicial frameworks.

Creating a separate cover page and integrating it into the main PDF document is feasible. Moreover, it is possible to apply a cover page to an already existing PDF. This involves importing the primary PDF, then either importing or creating the cover page. Subsequently, utilize the `mergePdf` method to amalgamate both PDF files.
