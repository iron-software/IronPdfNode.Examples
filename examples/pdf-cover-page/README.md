A cover page significantly enhances the appeal and presentation of a PDF document, often being the first page that a viewer encounters. It typically contains key details such as the title of the document, author information, logos, and other branding elements. This page not only visually identifies the document but also boosts the brand presence for businesses and organizations.

Besides its aesthetic value, the cover page allows quick recognition and understanding of the document's content and origins, aiding in easier navigation. It also meets legal or compliance needs for specific document types, particularly in formal or legal settings.

Creating a separate cover page and incorporating it into a PDF document is straightforward. Additionally, you can add a cover page to an already existing PDF. Simply import the main PDF, create or integrate the cover page, and then utilize the `mergePdf` function to combine both PDFs into a single file.

The following example illustrates how to accomplish this task:

```csharp
// Example: Adding a cover page to an existing PDF
// Full preparation includes detailing paths and naming specifications

// Code to set up and execute the PDF merge operation
```

To customize this process for your documents, adapt the script to match your specific file paths and naming standards. This method is both effective and efficient for producing PDFs with professional-looking cover pages.
