Adding a background or foreground to a PDF can significantly enhance its presentation. This modification can be applied to both newly created or existing PDFs.

Initially, the process starts by creating a PDF from a designated URL, which will serve as the primary document. Subsequently, we access an additional PDF named "MyBackground.pdf", intended for use as the background layer.

To incorporate the background, the `addBackgroundFromAnotherPdf` method is employed. This effectively places the content of "MyBackground.pdf" beneath the primary URL-rendered PDFâ€™s content.

Furthermore, an extra PDF dubbed "MyForeground.pdf" is loaded to serve as a foreground element. This overlay is applied to the very first page (page index 0) of the PDF document using the `addForegroundFromAnotherPdf` method, ensuring it appears above the existing material.

Ultimately, the modified PDF, which now comprises the original PDF, the added background, and the foreground overlay, is saved under the name "Complete.pdf."
