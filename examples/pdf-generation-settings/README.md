When transforming HTML content to PDFs, IronPDF allows users to tailor numerous rendering options. Adjustable parameters extend to custom paper sizes with various measurement units, the inclusion of HTML backgrounds, setting the page orientation, defining the document's title, introducing a delay in the rendering to accommodate asynchronous tasks like the loading of scripts or fonts, specifying the CSS media type, opting for a particular paper mode, embedding editable form fields, customizing margins, and affixing page numbers.

Two notably pivotal CSS media types are "screen" and "print." These directives guide how styles are applied depending on the media used for viewing or printing. Selecting "screen" optimizes the HTML for digital viewing, enhancing visual elements like colors and design layouts suitable for digital displays. In contrast, choosing "print" adapts the styling to optimize printed outputs, which are designed to enhance readability and ensure that formatting is preserved on physical paper. Occasionally, setting the media type to "screen" is crucial for rendering certain backgrounds in display contexts.

The purpose of introducing delays in the rendering process is to allow adequate time for the complete loading of JavaScript or custom fonts, ensuring that all page elements are properly rendered and displayed.
