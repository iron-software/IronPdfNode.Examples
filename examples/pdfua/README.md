PDF/UA (Portable Document Format/Universal Accessibility) is a globally recognized standard established for creating PDF files that are accessible to people with disabilities, notably those who use assistive technology like screen readers.

In the subsequent example, we illustrate the use of a conceptual `convertToPdfUA` method which transforms standard PDF documents into versions compliant with the PDF/UA criteria. Furthermore, we'll demonstrate the `saveAs` method that allows for the exporting of the PDF document.
