PDF/UA, also recognized as Portable Document Format for Universal Accessibility, is an international specification dedicated to making PDF documents more accessible. This standard seeks to facilitate the creation of PDFs in such a manner that allows people with disabilities—especially those employing assistive technologies like screen readers—to better interact with the content.

To transform standard PDF documents into versions that adhere to the PDF/UA guidelines, utilize the `convertToPdfUA` method. After conversion, apply the `saveAs` method to export the compliant PDF document.
