PDF/UA (Portable Document Format/Universal Accessibility) represents a global standard for crafting accessible PDF documents. This standard is dedicated to ensuring that PDFs are generated and formatted to accommodate individuals with disabilities, especially those employing assistive technologies like screen readers.

To transform standard PDFs into documents that adhere to the PDF/UA guidelines, utilize the `convertToPdfUA` method. Once converted, you can export the document using the `saveAs` method.
