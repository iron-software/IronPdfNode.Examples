To accurately display resources that require additional load time, like JavaScript, fonts, and network elements, it is crucial to set a render delay by using the `waitFor` class. This ensures that all assets fully load before rendering takes place.

When incorporating custom fonts from Google Fonts into your HTML content, adjust the rendering options by setting the `waitFor` property. Choose `RenderDelay` as the delay type and allocate a maximum wait time of 500 milliseconds.

Once the HTML has been processed, generate the PDF document using the features of [IronPDF's PDF Generation Library](https://ironpdf.com). After generation, review the PDF to confirm that the custom font is accurately rendered and visible.
