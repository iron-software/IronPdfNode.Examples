To ensure assets that need loading time, like JavaScript, fonts, and network resources, are properly rendered, it's crucial to define a render delay using the `waitFor` class.

For displaying HTML content with a custom Google Font, adjust the rendering settings to include the `waitFor` property. Choose `RenderDelay` as the waiting type and allocate a maximum delay of 500 milliseconds.

Once the HTML is rendered, convert it into a PDF using the features provided by [IronPDF's PDF Generation Library](https://ironpdf.com). You can then review the generated PDF to confirm the custom font is accurately loaded and presented.
