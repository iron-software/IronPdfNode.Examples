Both JavaScript and Node.js are built to handle asynchronous processing effectively. This feature is also supported by [IronPDF, a .NET PDF library](https://ironpdf.com), renowned for its capabilities in generating and manipulating PDFs with ease.

A key aspect of IronPDF is that many of its methods use promises. By taking advantage of this, developers can process multiple HTML contents concurrently, and then employ the `Promise.all` method to ensure all these tasks are completed.

It's important to remember that `Promise.all` does not guarantee each promise will be successful; it simply verifies that all of them have concluded.

Within such constructs, `await` is used in a `.map` function to pause the execution until the PDFs are returned, allowing any needed modifications on these documents. If the objective is just to generate PDFs without further adjustments, then employing `async` and `await` might be unnecessary.
