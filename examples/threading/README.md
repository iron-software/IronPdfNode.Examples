JavaScript and Node.js are both equipped to handle asynchronous operations. Similarly, [IronPDF, a .NET PDF library](https://ironpdf.com/), excels in creating and manipulating PDFs efficiently.

IronPDF typically uses methods that return promises, allowing for the concurrent rendering of multiple HTML documents. We can utilize the `Promise.all` method to pause execution until all these promises are resolved.

It's important to remember that `Promise.all` only confirms that the promises have been resolved, not that they were successful.

Using `await` within a `.map` function helps in pausing the process to wait for the generated PDF documents, allowing for further modifications to these documents. If the objective is simply to generate the PDFs without any further alteration, the implementation of `async` and `await` might be unnecessary.
