HTML content with form fields can be effectively transformed into editable PDF forms while maintaining the functionality of the form fields. This conversion process involves setting up an HTML form with various input options like text areas, radio selections, and checkbox fields, which facilitate user interactions through data entry and selection.

To make this possible, enable the `createPdfFormsFromHtml` setting by assigning it a value of `true`. This setting ensures that the HTML forms are transformed into editable PDF forms.

Proceed by converting the HTML content into a PDF file using the `PdfDocument.fromHtml` method. During this process, you'll need to provide rendering options through an object parameter.

Once the conversion is complete, use the `saveAs` method to save the generated document as "formField.pdf."
