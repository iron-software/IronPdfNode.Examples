You can also convert HTML forms to PDF while maintaining the form fields' functionality and data. This requires defining an HTML form with various user inputs such as text boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes, which enable data entry and selection options for users.

To begin, enable the `createPdfFormsFromHtml` setting by setting it to true, ensuring that the HTML form is transformed into an editable PDF form.

Then, transform the specified HTML content into a PDF file using the `PdfDocument.fromHtml` method, providing it with the necessary rendering options in an object parameter.

Conclude by saving this newly created PDF form as "formField.pdf" through the `saveAs` method.

For further guidance on crafting PDFs from HTML forms, you can explore more resources and examples on the [IronPDF Product Page](https://ironpdf.com).
