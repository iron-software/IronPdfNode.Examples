The `fromHtml` function is designed to transform HTML strings and files into PDF formats. This transformation ensures that the PDF outcome mirrors the output produced by the Google Chrome browser's print option. Leveraging the Chrome engine for HTML to PDF conversion, IronPDF guarantees a consistent and high-quality rendering matching Google Chrome's settings.

IronPDF extends beyond mere rendering. It offers a suite of options for PDF manipulation, integrating both rendering and modification capabilities. An interesting aspect of this integration is showcased through IronPDF's [HTML stamping feature](https://ironpdf.com/examples/stamping-html-pdf-multiple/). This feature involves converting HTML into PDF and then combining it with the main HTML body, resulting in documents that incorporate HTML stamps either behind or in front of the main content.
