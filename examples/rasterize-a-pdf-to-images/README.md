Converting a PDF to an image, or rasterizing a PDF, involves transforming each page of the document into a static image format such as JPEG or PNG. This technique is often utilized when individual pages or images from the PDF need to be extracted for various applications, including display on web pages or inclusion in other documents.

To perform this conversion, the [IronPDF's PDF to Image Converter](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/pdf-to-image/) can be used. This tool allows the selection of the desired output image format. Each generated image will be appropriately named with "_pageNumber" suffix, reflecting its page number in the original PDF document.
