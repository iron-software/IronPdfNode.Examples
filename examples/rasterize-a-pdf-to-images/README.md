Converting a PDF document into an image format, like JPEG or PNG, by rasterizing each page involves transforming the pages into standalone image files. This technique is particularly useful for extracting pages or images from a PDF for use cases such as presenting them on web platforms or embedding them into separate documents.

To accomplish this, you can use [IronPDF's PDF to Image Converter](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/pdf-to-image/), which allows you to specify the desired image format for the resulting files. The images produced are conveniently labeled with "_pageNumber", trending the sequence of their respective pages in the PDF, making organization simple and efficient.
