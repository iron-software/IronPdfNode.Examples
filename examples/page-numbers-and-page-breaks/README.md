IronPDF excels at seamlessly converting HTML content to PDF documents, including the implementation of page breaks. 

Page breaks in HTML serve as commands to web browsers or rendering systems, instructing them to initiate a new page during display or printing. This feature is particularly useful for controlling the layout of printed materials and ensuring specific sections commence on a new page.

Additionally, the provided code setup enhances the PDF output by inserting the page number at the bottom center of each page. Displayed in the format "`{page}` of `{total-pages}`," these numbers are restricted to a height of no more than 15 units.
