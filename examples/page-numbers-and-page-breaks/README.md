Page breaks are expertly handled during the PDF conversion process with IronPDF.

In the context of HTML, a page break acts as a signal to either a web browser or a rendering tool, indicating when to begin a new page for display or print purposes. This feature is particularly useful in managing the presentation of printed materials or ensuring that specific sections commence on a new page.

Additionally, the provided snippet configures the PDF rendering settings to insert the page number at the lower center part of each page. The format used is "`{page}` of `{total-pages}`", with a maximum height constraint of 15 units for the page numbers.
