Transforming a TIFF image with one or more pages into a PDF document can be efficiently achieved with just one line of code.

To perform this conversion, use the `PdfGenerator.imageToPdf` method. This versatile method also supports other image formats including PNG, JPG, and JPEG, not just TIFF.

Moreover, this function is designed to handle an image buffer, which is particularly useful when images are sourced from network locations.

For further details on this functionality and to view comprehensive examples, refer to the [IronPDF Image to PDF Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdf-image-to-pdf/).
