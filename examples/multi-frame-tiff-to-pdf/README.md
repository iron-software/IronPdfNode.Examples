Converting a TIFF file, whether it's a single or multiple-paged document, to PDF can be achieved with just one line of code.

Use the `PdfGenerator.imageToPdf` method to transform TIFF files, as well as other image formats like PNG, JPG, and JPEG into PDFs. This versatile method also accepts an image buffer, making it convenient for processing images obtained from a network source.
