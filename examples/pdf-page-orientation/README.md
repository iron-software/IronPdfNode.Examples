Page orientation and rotation are often mistaken for one another, especially when considering a 90-degree rotation similar to landscape orientation.

Page orientation determines the baseline layout of a page, which can be either vertical (portrait) or horizontal (landscape).

Conversely, page rotation adjusts the angle at which a page is displayed. This feature is handy for aligning content properly or catering to specific viewing requirements. Common rotation angles include 90, 180, and 270 degrees.

For more details on how to set page orientation when rendering PDFs, check out [IronPDF's guide on setting page orientation](https://ironpdf.com/nodejs/examples/pdf-page-orientation/). It's important to note, however, that once a PDF is created, its orientation cannot be altered. On the other hand, you can rotate an existing PDF document at any time, but this adjustment cannot be made during the PDF rendering stage.
