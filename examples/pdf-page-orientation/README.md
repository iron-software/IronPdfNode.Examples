Sometimes, there may be confusion between page orientation and page rotation, especially when considering a 90-degree rotation and the landscape setting for orientation.

Page orientation is the initial setup of a page that determines if it's laid out vertically (portrait) or horizontally (landscape).

Conversely, page rotation involves altering the pageâ€™s angle, which can shift the orientation as required. This adjustment is particularly useful for aligning content properly or to suit specific viewing needs. Typically, page angles are adjusted to 90, 180, or 270 degrees.

You can explore more about how to adjust page orientation during the PDF generation phase by consulting [IronPDF's comprehensive guide on page orientation](https://ironpdf.com/nodejs/examples/pdf-page-orientation/). It's important to note, however, that while you cannot change the page orientation of an already existing PDF, you can apply rotation to it. Unlike orientation, rotation does not allow adjustments during the document creation process.
