This action is executed instantly, but this quick rendering can encounter problems while loading JavaScript or fonts. To circumvent these issues, it's recommended to utilize the `waitFor` class.

Issues that may arise from inadequately loaded JavaScript or fonts include:

- Text content becoming invisible
- Content appearing incorrectly
