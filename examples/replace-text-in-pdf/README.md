The following code snippet illustrates the process of text substitution within a PDF document. This utility can be employed for both newly created and pre-existing PDFs.

To execute a text replacement within a PDF, the `replaceText` method is employed. This method demands three parameters: the initial text you wish to locate, the new text that will replace the original, and the page number where the alteration is to be made. In this instance, the text ".NET6" is replaced with ".NET7" on the designated page.

After the text substitution is finalized, the altered PDF can be saved using the `saveAs` method. For additional details on PDF manipulation techniques, please visit the [IronPDF Features Page](https://ironpdf.com/features).
