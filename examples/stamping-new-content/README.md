Using HTML stamping, you can insert a specific HTML fragment into a document. This approach allows for flexibility in design using inline CSS styling. Images can be included directly within the HTML and subsequently stamped onto the PDF document.

IronPDF provides a range of stamping capabilities that encompass HTML, text, images, and even barcodes. You have the advantage of precisely positioning each stamp with both vertical and horizontal coordinates. These positions are finely tunable with offsets, ensuring exact placement in the PDF. Moreover, most types of stamps can be customized with options for opacity adjustment and rotation.
