HTML stamping utilizes an HTML snippet, allowing you to manage the layout with inline CSS styles effectively. As demonstrated in the preceding code, we insert images into the HTML before stamping them directly onto the PDF.

IronPDF provides a robust set of stamping capabilities including options for stamping HTML content, text, images, and even barcodes. It's possible to meticulously set the placement of each stamp by specifying both vertical and horizontal coordinates. These placements can be fine-tuned with offsets to ensure exact alignment. Additionally, many types of stamps offer features such as adjustable opacity and rotation settings.
