Using HTML stamping, you can insert an HTML snippet that allows for detailed control over its appearance via inline CSS. Below is an example where images are embedded directly in the HTML and then stamped onto the document.

IronPDF provides a wide array of stamping options that include HTML, text, images, and barcodes. You can accurately set the position for each stamp by choosing both vertical and horizontal base locations. These can be fine-tuned with offsets for precise placement. Additionally, most types of stamps can be customized with opacity and rotation settings.
