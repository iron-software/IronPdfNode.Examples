IronPDF provides a diverse array of stamping options, such as HTML, text, image, and barcode stamps. You can position each stamp specifically using both vertical and horizontal coordinates, and further refine their location with pixel-perfect vertical and horizontal offsets.

For HTML stamping, you can utilize an HTML fragment, complete with comprehensive inline CSS styling, to create designs suited to your needs. For a detailed exploration of how to apply HTML stamping effectively, please visit the [IronPDF Stamping Guide](https://ironpdf.com/docs/).

If your requirements are simpler and do not necessitate custom fonts fetched online, text stamping offers a quick and efficient alternative. You can learn more about this feature by viewing the [IronPDF Text Stamping Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/docs/).

Adding a logo through image stamping is an excellent method for applying a branding mark on a PDF. Each image stamp can be customized in terms of both rotation and opacity to alter its visual impact. These stamps can also be set up as watermarks. For further details on utilizing image stamps and watermarks, refer to the [IronPDF Watermark Tutorial](https://ironpdf.com/docs/).

Barcode stamping is particularly useful for incorporating barcodes into your PDFs, enhancing them with a professional touch. To get instructions on how to generate and customize barcodes, consult the [IronPDF Barcode Stamping Instructions](https://ironpdf.com/docs/).
