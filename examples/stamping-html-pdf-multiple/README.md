IronPDF offers a diverse range of stamping options which include HTML, text, image, and barcode stamps. Each stamp's placement can be precisely controlled through vertical and horizontal coordinates, and further adjusted with pixel-perfect accuracy using vertical and horizontal offsets.

Implementing HTML stamps is facilitated through the insertion of an HTML snippet that fully supports inline CSS for detailed styling. For a comprehensive guide on using HTML stamps effectively, refer to the [IronPDF Stamping Guide](https://ironpdf.com/docs/).

For a simpler stamping option, text stamping provides a quick solution without the need for elaborate fonts that depend on online resources. To understand more about the benefits and methods of text stamping, you can visit the [IronPDF Text Stamping Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/docs/).

Image stamping serves as an excellent method for incorporating logos swiftly into your PDFs. Each image stamp can be customized with options for rotation and opacity, making it possible to tailor the stamp's visual impact, including setting it as a watermark. For additional details on configuring image and watermark stamps, explore the [IronPDF Watermark Tutorial](https://ironpdf.com/docs/).

Barcode stamping is another feature that allows the insertion of barcodes into a PDF, enhancing the document's functionality and aesthetic.
