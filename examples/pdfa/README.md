IronPDF offers capabilities to convert PDFs to the PDF/A-3b format, a stringent version of the ISO PDF specification tailored for creating documents that maintain their original appearance indefinitely for archival purposes.

IronPDF actively supports Google's endeavors to improve PDF archiving and accessibility, aligning with Section 508 standards governing PDF documents. In 2021, IronPDF adopted the Google Chromium HTML rendering engine for converting HTML to PDFs. This change enhances the software by integrating [Google's accessibility enhancements for PDF creation](https://ironpdf.com/blog/chromium.org/2020/07/using-chrome-to-generate-more.html).

The `convertToPdfA` function in IronPDF enables the transformation of standard PDFs into versions that meet archival standards, facilitating the export of these compliant documents.
