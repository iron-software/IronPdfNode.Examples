Transform an HTML file into a PDF document by employing the `fromHtml` method from the IronPDF library, a product of Iron Software. This method ensures that the PDF document effectively encapsulates all the content from the specified HTML file.

Once the conversion is complete, the `saveAs` method allows you to store the document with the filename 'output.pdf' in either the current directory or another directory of your choosing.
