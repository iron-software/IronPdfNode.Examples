Transform an HTML file into a PDF using the `fromHtml` method from Iron Software's IronPDF library. The PDF generated will incorporate all of the content from your HTML file.

Once the PDF is created, you can utilize the `saveAs` method to store the document with the name 'output.pdf' either in the current directory or in another location you specify.
