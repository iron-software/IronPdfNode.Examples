Enhance the appearance of your PDF documents by adding HTML headers and footers using IronPDF, a robust library from Iron Software designed for sophisticated PDF creation and modification.

Start by creating a header that includes a dividing line and an HTML snippet. Set the desired maximum height for the header utilizing the powerful PDF rendering capabilities of IronPDF. For the footer, you can utilize the `htmlHeader` property offered by IronPDF to define its content.

It's important to remember that IronPDF does not automatically adjust to detect the dimensions of headers and footers. This lack of automatic sizing can result in overlaps with the main body of your HTML content. To avoid this, adjust the margins to ensure that both the header and footer are positioned correctly within the document layout.
