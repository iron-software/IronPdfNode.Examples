Set up rendering options to include HTML elements in the headers and footers when producing a PDF document with IronPDF. Iron Software offers this library for sophisticated PDF generation and editing capabilities.

Start by defining your header content, which can include a divider line and an HTML snippet. You should also set the maximum height for the header using the versatile PDF rendering options available in IronPDF. In a similar fashion, establish your footer content by utilizing the `htmlHeader` property from IronPDF.

Keep in mind that the heights of the header and footer are not automatically determined, which may result in them overlapping with the primary HTML content. Adjust the margins to ensure that both the header and footer are correctly aligned without encroachment.
