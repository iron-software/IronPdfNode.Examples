# Printing PDF Documents in Node.js Environments

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/nodejs-print-pdf/>***


In the realm of server-side JavaScript, managing PDF documents efficiently can be crucial for a variety of applications, from generating invoices to creating reports. While Node.js adequately supports numerous utilities for handling PDF files, printing them directly from your Node.js application can sometimes be a tricky affair. This guide aims to clarify those steps and provide a smooth path for developers looking to implement PDF printing functionality within their Node.js projects.

## Choosing the Right Library

Before diving into the specifics of printing, it’s essential to select the appropriate library to handle PDF operations. There are several quality options available within the Node.js ecosystem, such as PDFKit, node-pdf, and others. For our purposes, we'll focus on how to implement PDF printing by using a hypothetical, yet robust, library that interacts seamlessly with Node.js.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Implement PDF Printing

### 1. **Setting Up Your Node.js Project**

First, you'll want to set up a basic Node.js project if you don’t have one already. Create a new directory for your project and initiate it with `npm`:

```bash
mkdir my-pdf-project
cd my-pdf-project
npm init -y
```

### 2. **Installing the PDF Library**

Install the library that you have chosen to handle PDF operations. If you're following along with a fictive universal library, you would typically run something like:

```bash
npm install universal-pdf-lib
```

### 3. **Integrating the Library into Your Application**

Now, integrate this library into your application. Start by requiring it in your script:

```javascript
const PDFLib = require('universal-pdf-lib');
```

### 4. **Implementing PDF Printing Functionality**

To print PDF files, you’ll likely need to create a function that can take the path of a PDF file as an input and handle its processing:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

function printPDF(filePath) {
  const fullPath = path.resolve(filePath);
  PDFLib.print(fullPath, {
    onSuccess: () => console.log('Printing completed successfully.'),
    onError: (error) => console.error('Error during printing:', error)
  });
}
```

This function `printPDF` will use the `print` method from your PDF library, handling files using the Node.js `path` module to resolve file paths accurately.

### 5. **Calling the Function**

You can now call the `printPDF` function from anywhere in your application to print a PDF file:

```javascript
printPDF('./path/to/your/document.pdf');
```

Ensure that the file path is correct, and the function will handle the rest by leveraging the library’s capabilities.

## Conclusion

Integrating PDF printing in your Node.js applications doesn’t have to be complicated with the right tools and approaches. By following these steps, developers can enhance their applications with powerful PDF management and printing features, making it easier to deliver rich document-based functionalities to users.
