# How To Print PDF Files Using Node.js

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/nodejs-print-pdf/>***


Printing PDF documents is essential for various business processes, and Node.js developers often require a method to handle such tasks programmatically. The tutorial provided will guide you through the steps necessary to implement PDF printing functionality within a Node.js application using a third-party library.

## Overview

This document provides an in-depth guide on how to enable PDF printing capabilities in your Node.js projects. By following this step-by-step tutorial, you will learn how to integrate PDF printing functionality efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Printing PDFs in Node.js

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Node.js Environment

Before initiating any printing task, you must ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from its [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 2: Install the Necessary Library

To handle PDF printing in Node.js, you need to install a reliable third-party library that facilitates printing functions. We recommend using the `pdf-to-printer` package for its simplicity and efficiency.

### Instructions:
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to install the library:

```bash
npm install pdf-to-printer
```

### Step 3: Implement the Printing Function

After installing the required package, you can now write the function to print your PDF file. Below is a basic example illustrating how to send a PDF document to the printer.

### Example Code:

```javascript
const { print } = require('pdf-to-printer');

async function printPDF(pdfPath) {
  try {
    await print(pdfPath);
    console.log('Printing job successfully sent to the printer');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send print job:', error);
  }
}

printPDF("/path/to/your/document.pdf");
```

In this code snippet, the `printPDF` function takes the path of the PDF file as an argument and attempts to send the document to the connected printer. Errors are handled gracefully to inform the user of any issues encountered during the printing process.

## Conclusion

By integrating the `pdf-to-printer` library into your Node.js application, you can easily add PDF printing capabilities. This tutorial aims to assist developers in setting up a workflow that can handle the printing of PDF files programmatically, enhancing the automation and efficiency of your software applications.
