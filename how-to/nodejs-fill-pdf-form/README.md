In today's guide, we'll explore how to populate a PDF form using Node.js. We'll harness the capabilities of IronPDF, a sophisticated .NET library tailored for the creation and manipulation of PDF documents. IronPDF integrates fluently with .NET environments, providing developers with an extensive suite of tools for handling PDFs effectively and at scale.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Node.js**: Your system should have Node.js installed. It's available for download from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **IronPDF license key**: Secure a license key for IronPDF to access its full range of PDF processing features. Start with a free trial or purchase a license directly from the IronPDF [product page](https://ironpdf.com/).

## Installation

To utilize IronPDF in your Node.js application, you first need to install it. Despite IronPDF being a .NET library, it can be integrated with Node.js via a .NET Core wrapper. Consult the IronPDF [installation guide](https://ironpdf.com/docs/#installation-guide) for comprehensive instructions on setting up and configuring the necessary environment and wrapper package.

## Populating PDF Forms

With everything set up, you are ready to populate PDF forms using IronPDF. Below is a simple example illustrating how to accomplish this task.

```javascript
// Example code to populate a PDF form
// Import required components
const { IronPDFWrapper } = require('iron-pdf-wrapper');

// Instantiate IronPDF
const pdfHandler = new IronPDFWrapper('your-license-key');

// Open the PDF document
const pdfFile = './example.pdf';
const pdfDoc = pdfHandler.loadPdf(pdfFile);

// Populate the form fields
pdfDoc.fillFormField('formField1', 'Sample Value');
pdfDoc.fillFormField('formField2', 'Another Value');

// Output the populated PDF
const savedPath = './filled_example.pdf';
pdfDoc.saveAs(savedPath);

console.log('PDF form has been populated and stored successfully at:', savedPath);
```
