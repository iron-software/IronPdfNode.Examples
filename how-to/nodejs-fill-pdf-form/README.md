## Filling Out PDF Forms

With IronPDF set up, you can begin filling out PDF forms. Here is a straightforward example to show how to populate a PDF form.

```javascript
// Example code for filling out a PDF form
// Import the necessary modules
const { IronPDFWrapper } = require('iron-pdf-wrapper');

// Initialize IronPDF with your license key
const pdfProcessor = new IronPDFWrapper('your-license-key');

// Load your PDF file
const pdfPath = './example.pdf';
const pdfDocument = pdfProcessor.loadPdf(pdfPath);

// Populate the form fields
pdfDocument.fillFormField('formField1', 'Sample Value');
pdfDocument.fillFormField('formField2', 'Another Value');

// Save the newly filled PDF
const outputPath = './filled_example.pdf';
pdfDocument.saveAs(outputPath);

console.log('PDF form has been successfully filled and saved at:', outputPath);
```
